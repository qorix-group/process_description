Overview
^^^^^^^^

The module process_description provides a process model establishing organization rules
for developing open source software in the automotive industry, which can be used in
safety and security context.

The process model provides processes, which conform to state-of the art standards

ASPICE 4.0
ISO 26262
ISO 21434
ISO PAS 8926

Disclaimer
----------

This release note does not "release for production", as it does not come with a safety
argumentation and a performed safety assessment.
The work products compiled in the safety package are created with care according to a
process satisfying standards, but the project, being a non-profit and open source
organization, can not take over any liability for its content.

Changes to the Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Features
------------

Building blocks meta model is reworked.
(https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/index.html).
Contains now Features, Components as own elements, adapt linkage names, e.g.
Requirements are now "derived_from" parent requirements, correct some linkages between
elements

Module Templates removed from Folder Templates and
(https://eclipse-score.github.io/process_description/main/folder_templates/index.html)

moved now to module_templates folder
(https://eclipse-score.github.io/module_template/main/)

Implementation is now defined.

Now versioning of sphinx-needs elements is introduced. Thus this version is the first
baseline of the process_description.

The process model contains

- General concepts e.g. for Building Blocks and their traceability
- Process meta model for proper modeling
- Process areas covering the required standards
- Roles, Work Products, Workflows defining the process areas
- Standard overview and coverage information
- Folder templates for simplifying deployment for users
- Glossary
- Release Notes
