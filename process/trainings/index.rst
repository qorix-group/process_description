   THE CONTENT IS CREATED BY AI AND MAY CONTAIN ERRORS.
   THE CONTENT PURPOSE IS ONLY PROVIDED FOR VISUALIZATION AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRAINING PORTAL.
   PLEASE VERIFY THE INFORMATION BEFORE USE.

   Human verification has NOT been performed to ensure the accuracy of the content,
   and the content may not be suitable for actual training purposes.

Self-paced interactive training portals for the Eclipse S-CORE process areas.
Each portal is built from editable Markdown source files and rendered as a
standalone HTML site with progress tracking and embedded quizzes.

.. note::
   The portals open as self-contained HTML applications.
   Progress is saved locally in your browser — no server or login required.

Training Source and Build
-------------------------

Each training is maintained under
``process/trainings/<training_name>/source/`` as editable Markdown files and
rebuilt automatically whenever the documentation is built via
``bazel run //:docs``.

To rebuild a specific training manually:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd process/trainings/trainings_requirements_engineering/source
   python build.py

Adding a new training
---------------------

1. Copy the template from ``process/trainings/trainings_templates/content/``
   into a new ``trainings_<area>/source/content/`` directory.
2. Copy ``build.py``, ``template.html``, ``requirements.txt``, and ``assets/``
   from an existing training source folder.
3. Update the ``MODULES`` array in ``assets/app.js`` and the ``OUT`` path in
   ``build.py``.
4. Add a grid card above pointing to the generated portal.
