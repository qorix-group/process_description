# Why Requirements Engineering?

Requirements engineering is not bureaucracy — it is the foundation that connects
a customer's need to the last line of tested code. In safety- and security-critical
automotive software this chain must be complete, correct, and auditable.
This module explains why, who is involved, and what standards demand.

## 1.1 The Role of Requirements in Safety-Critical Software

Modern automotive software controls safety-critical actuators — brakes, steering,
power management — and runs in open-source collaborative environments where dozens of
contributors work across organisational boundaries. Without a structured requirements
process two problems become inevitable:

1. **No agreed specification** — contributors implement different interpretations
   of the same need.
2. **No audit trail** — safety and security auditors cannot verify that every
   standard requirement is addressed.

:::important Why RE is Mandated by Standards
ISO 26262 (Part 8, SWE.1), ASPICE PAM 4.0, ISO/SAE 21434, and ISO PAS 8926 all
iltiyexplicitly require a documented, traceable requirements hierarchy as a precondition
for safety and security releases. Without it, certification is impossible.
:::

The S-CORE Requirements Engineering process provides a single, standardised answer
to both problems: a hierarchy of requirement levels with defined attributes,
mandatory reviews, and automatic traceability links to code and tests.

## 1.2 Stakeholders and Their Information Needs

The requirements hierarchy must satisfy the needs of every stakeholder who will
either write, review, implement, test, or audit requirements. The S-CORE process
identifies the following key stakeholders:

| Stakeholder | Source ID | Role in S-CORE | What they need from requirements |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Project Lead** | `rl__project_lead` | Defines platform specification and content, creates project timeline, tracks project progress | Clear stakeholder requirements as a project description |
| **SW Architect** | `rl__committer` | Breaks down platform specification into features, derives feature/component architecture, allocates requirements to architecture elements, defines AoUs from architecture | Feature requirements and AoUs to drive architecture decisions |
| **Tester** | `rl__committer` | Verifies that the specification is satisfied by the elements under test, considers AoUs for test case specification | Verifiable, testable requirements with traceability to test cases |
| **Safety Architect** | `rl__safety_engineer` | Performs Dependent Failure Analysis, qualitative safety analysis (e.g. FMEA), initiates additional requirements and AoUs to cover failures | Requirements with safety attributes and independence information |
| **Security Architect** | `rl__security_engineer` | Performs Trust Boundary Analysis, Defense in Depth Analysis, qualitative security analysis (TARA) | Requirements with security attributes |
| **Module/Tooling SW Developer** | `rl__delivery_team` | Implements SW according to specification, creates traceability by linking specification to code, considers AoUs of other components, creates AoUs for the component under development | Component requirements with clear acceptance criteria |
| **Feature User** | *(no formal role ID)* | Gets detailed information on the specification of a feature, is informed about boundary conditions (AoUs) | AoUs — boundary conditions they must fulfil when using the SW |
| **Platform SW Developer of the Reference Integration** | `rl__platform_team` | Implements requirements for reference integration | Component and feature requirements |

:::tip Open Source Working Mode
In S-CORE **any Contributor may write a requirement**, but every requirement must be
approved by a Committer or Project Lead before it is merged. Safety and Security
Managers provide support when their domain is involved.
:::

## 1.3 Standard Connections

The S-CORE requirements process implements requirements from multiple standards
simultaneously. Understanding these connections helps prioritise engineering effort.

| Standard | Relevant Clause | What it requires |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **ISO 26262** | Part 8, SWE.1 | SW requirements specification with safety classification, traceability, and review |
| **ASPICE PAM 4.0** | SWE.1 | Elicitation, documentation, agreement, and traceability of SW requirements |
| **ISO/SAE 21434** | §10.5.1 | Cybersecurity requirements derived from TARA, traceable through development |
| **ISO PAS 8926** | §4.5.2.1 | To Be Defined |

:::definition Assumptions of Use (AoU)
A special requirement type that defines the **boundary conditions the user of a
software element must fulfil** to ensure safe and secure operation. AoUs are
exportable to integrators so they can include them in their own requirements
management systems.
:::

## 1.4 Roles and Approval Chains

The S-CORE process defines clear responsibility for each level of the hierarchy:

- **Stakeholder requirements and SW-Platform AoU:** Written by Contributor (`rl__contributor`), approved by Project Lead (`rl__project_lead`), supported by Safety Manager (`rl__safety_manager`).
- **Feature requirements and Feature AoU:** Written by Contributor (`rl__contributor`), approved by Project Lead (`rl__project_lead`), supported by Safety Manager (`rl__safety_manager`) and Security Manager (`rl__security_manager`).
- **Component requirements and Component AoU:** Written by Contributor (`rl__contributor`), approved by Committer (`rl__committer`), supported by Safety Manager (`rl__safety_manager`) and Security Manager (`rl__security_manager`).
- **Tool/Process requirements:** Written by Contributor (`rl__contributor`), approved by Committer (`rl__committer`).

This separation ensures that the level of scrutiny matches the safety and security
implications of the requirement.

:::collapsible Why does the approval chain differ between Feature and Component level?
Feature requirements describe platform-level integration behaviour and are visible
to all users of the platform — they require Project Lead approval because they
represent agreements between the platform team and its stakeholders.

Component requirements are implementation-specific and concern only the component
team — Committer approval is sufficient, as Committers are the technical
gatekeepers for their component.

:::quiz module-1-check

- q: "Who is responsible for approving Feature Requirements in S-CORE?"
  options:
    - text: "Contributor"
    - text: "Project Lead"
      correct: true
    - text: "Safety Manager"
    - text: "Feature User"
  feedback: >-
    Correct: B. Feature requirements are written by any Contributor but must be approved
    by the Project Lead. Safety and Security Managers provide support but do not approve.

- q: "Which standard requires SW requirements with a safety classification attribute, traceability, and formal review?"
  options:
    - text: "ISO/SAE 21434"
    - text: "ISO PAS 8926"
    - text: "ISO 26262 Part 8 / ASPICE SWE.1"
      correct: true
    - text: "IEC 61508"
  feedback: >-
    Correct: C. ISO 26262 Part 8 (in conjunction with ASPICE SWE.1) drives the SW requirements
    specification obligations in S-CORE. ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO PAS 8926 add cybersecurity
    and ADS-specific requirements on top.

- q: "An integrator using an S-CORE platform component needs to know the boundary conditions they must satisfy for safe use. Which requirement type addresses this?"
  options:
    - text: "Stakeholder Requirements"
    - text: "Feature Requirements"
    - text: "Process Requirements"
    - text: "Assumptions of Use (AoU)"
      correct: true
  feedback: >-
    Correct: D. Assumptions of Use (AoUs) define the boundary conditions that the user of a
    software element must fulfil. They are exportable so integrators can incorporate them
    into their own requirements management systems.
