   :tags: implementation

In this section a concept for the implementation will be discussed. Inputs for this concepts are
both the requirements of ISO26262 Part-6 Chapter 8+9 and ASPICE SWE 3+4.

Inputs
******

#.  ISO 26262 Part-6 Chapter 8+9
#.  ASPICE SWE 3+4
#.  Component Requirements :need:`wp__requirements_comp` and Architecture :need:`wp__component_arch`
#.  Software Development Plan :need:`gd_temp__software_development_plan`

Outputs

Detailed Design
===============

In this step, the **components** are broken down into smaller, independent **units** that can be
**tested separately** during the unit testing phase. This decomposition shall support the implementation
and testing of the component's requirements while adhering to the design principles and patterns
established in the architecture.

Following the **Detailed Design Template** :need:`gd_temp__detailed_design`, we must document the
**design decisions** and **constraints** that guide the decomposition of the component into multiple
units. These decisions should be made based on the following ideas:

-  **Design principles**
-  **Design patterns**
-  **Testability strategies**

The goal is to ensure that the decomposition supports **reusability**, **maintainability**,
**scalability**, **extensibility** and **ease of testing**.

The detailed design and implementation should follow an **iterative approach**, allowing for
continuous improvements in quality through multiple cycles of refinement.

The implementation concept intentionally stays at a high level. Practical guidance for
unit decomposition, source-code documentation, optional diagrams and naming consistency
for traceability is defined in :need:`Implementation Guideline <gd_guidl__implementation>`.
