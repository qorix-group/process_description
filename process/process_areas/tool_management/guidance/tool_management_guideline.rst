Guideline
=========

Tool Qualification
==================

.. gd_guidl:: Tool Qualification
   :id: gd_guidl__tool_qualification
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_11491, std_req__iso26262__support_11492

   | The tool qualification shall be based on the method validation of the software tool.

Tailoring
=========

.. gd_guidl:: Tool Requirements Tailored
   :id: gd_guidl__tool_req_tailored
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_11471, std_req__iso26262__support_11472, std_req__iso26262__support_11473, std_req__iso26262__support_11474,
              std_req__iso26262__support_11481, std_req__iso26262__support_11482, std_req__iso26262__support_11483


   This part of the guideline links to all the requirements which are not fulfilled by the
   tool management process. Make sure these are tailored out in the safety plans
   for your project (documented in the PMP). Reasoning given below must be confirmed there.

   The reasoning is:

   - Some methods for tool qualification are not applied
