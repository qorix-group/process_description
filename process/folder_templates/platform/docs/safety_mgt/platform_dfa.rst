Platform DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis)
=========================================

.. document:: Platform DFA
   :id: doc__platform_dfa
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: NO
   :realizes: wp__platform_dfa
   :tags: template

.. note:: The platform DFA is only performed once at platform level to analyse the dependencies between the features of the platform.
          The results shall be used as an input for the safety analysis so that general safety mechanisms are only defined once and not in every single safety analysis.

.. note:: Use the content of the document to describe e.g. why a fault model is not applicable for the diagram.


The DFA for the platform is performed. To show evidence that all failure initiators are considered, the applicability has to be filled out in the
following tables. For all applicable failure initiators, the DFA has to be performed.

Dependent Failure Initiators
----------------------------

Shared resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Shared libraries is only than applicable as a shared resource if the feature and the related safety mechanisms are using this specific library. If the library is not used by the feature or the related safety mechanisms, it is not applicable as shared resource at the end.

Section is **only applicable if a divers SW development is needed** due to decomposition.

:note: Section shall be applied only once to analyse all dependencies of the features. Results shall be checked during of the analysis of new features if this is applicable to the feature.
