DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis)
================================

.. document:: [Your Component Name] DFA
   :id: doc__component_name_dfa
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :realizes: wp__sw_component_dfa
   :tags: template

.. note:: Use the content of the document to describe e.g. why a fault model is not applicable for the diagram.

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Component.

    - Modify ``Your Component Name`` to be your Component Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Component Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_dfa``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Dependent Failure Initiators
----------------------------

.. code-block:: rst

    .. comp_saf_dfa:: <Title>
       :violates: <Component architecture>
       :id: comp_saf_dfa__<Component>__<Element descriptor>
       :failure_id: <ID from DFA failure initiators :need:`gd_guidl__dfa_failure_initiators`>

       :mitigated_by: <ID from Component Requirement | ID from AoU Component Requirement>
       :mitigation_issue: <ID from Issue Tracker>
       :sufficient: <yes|no>
       :status: <valid|invalid>

.. note::   argument is inside the 'content'. Therefore content is mandatory

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your component DFA.

    - The above "code-block" directive must be updated
    - Fill in all the needed information in the <brackets>
