.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your needs.

    - Modify ``Your Component Name`` to be your Component Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Component Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and followed by ``_architecture``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

General Description

Design Decisions

Design Constraints

Rationale Behind Architecture Decomposition
*******************************************
mandatory: a motivation for the decomposition or reason for not further splitting it into sub components.

.. note:: Common decisions across components / cross cutting concepts is at the higher level.

Static Architecture
-------------------

The components are designed to cover the expectations from the feature architecture
(i.e. if already exists a definition it should be taken over and enriched).

.. comp_arc_sta:: Component Name (Static View)
   :id: comp_arc_sta__component_name__static_view
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: invalid
   :implements: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name
   :fulfils: comp_req__component_name__some_title
   :includes: comp_arc_sta__component_name__2

   .. needarch::
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

      {{ draw_component(need(), needs) }}

Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

.. comp_arc_dyn:: Dynamic View
   :id: comp_arc_dyn__component_name__dynamic_view
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :status: invalid
   :fulfils: comp_req__component_name__some_title

   put here a sequence diagram


Interfaces
----------

.. code-block:: rst

   .. real_arc_int:: <Title>
      :id: real_arc_int__<component>__<Title>
      :security: <YES|NO>
      :safety: <QM|ASIL_B>
      :fulfils: <link to component requirement id>
      :language: cpp

Lower Level Components
----------------------

.. comp_arc_sta:: Component Name 2
   :id: comp_arc_sta__component_name__2
   :status: invalid
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: YES
   :implements: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name

   no architecture but detailed design

.. note::
   Architecture can be split into multiple files. At component level the public interfaces to be used by the user and tester to be shown.

.. attention::
    The above directives must be updated according to your component architecture.

    - Replace the example content by the real content (according to :need:`gd_guidl__arch_design`)
    - Set the status to valid and start the review/merge process
