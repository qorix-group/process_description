.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Feature.

    - Modify ``Your Feature Name`` to be your Feature Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Feature Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and followed by ``_architecture``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Rationale Behind Architecture Decomposition
*******************************************
mandatory: a motivation for the decomposition

.. note:: Common decisions across features / cross cutting concepts is at the high level.

Static Architecture
-------------------

.. feat_arc_sta:: Static View
   :id: feat_arc_sta__feature_name__static_view
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :status: invalid
   :fulfils: feat_req__feature_name__some_title
   :includes: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name

   .. needarch::
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

      {{ draw_feature(need(), needs) }}

Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

.. feat_arc_dyn:: Dynamic View
   :id: feat_arc_dyn__feature_name__dynamic_view
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :status: invalid
   :fulfils: feat_req__feature_name__some_title

   put here a sequence diagram

Logical Interfaces
------------------

.. logic_arc_int:: Interface Name
   :id: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :status: invalid

   .. needarch::
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

      {{ draw_interface(need(), needs) }}

.. logic_arc_int_op:: Operation
   :id: logic_arc_int_op__feature_name__operation
   :security: YES
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :status: invalid
   :included_by: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name

Module Viewpoint
----------------

The following modules are needed to be defined to be able to draw the static feature view.
They will be replaced by linking the proper module definitions in the used module's repositories as soon as those exist.

.. mod_view_sta:: Module Name
   :id: mod_view_sta__feature_name__module_name
   :includes: comp_arc_sta__feature_name__component_name

   .. needarch::
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

      {{ draw_module(need(), needs) }}

Used Components
---------------

The following components are needed to be defined to be able to draw the static feature view.
They will be replaced by linking the proper SW component definitions in the used module's repositories as soon as those exist.

.. comp_arc_sta:: Component Name
   :id: comp_arc_sta__feature_name__component_name
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :security: YES
   :status: invalid
   :implements: logic_arc_int__feature_name__interface_name

.. note::
   Architecture can be split into multiple files, it is an High level architecture_design
   which can be shown without actual c++/rust interfaces and data types
   and there will be link to lower level architecture till code to get actual api descriptions.

.. attention::
    The above directives must be updated according to your feature architecture.

    - Replace the example content by the real content (according to :need:`gd_guidl__arch__design`)
    - Set the status to valid and start the review/merge process
