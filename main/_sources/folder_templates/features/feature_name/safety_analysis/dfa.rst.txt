DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis)
================================

.. document:: [Your Feature Name] DFA
   :id: doc__feature_name_dfa
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :realizes: wp__feature_dfa
   :tags: template

.. note:: Use the content of the document to describe e.g. why a fault model is not applicable for the diagram.

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Feature.

    - Modify ``Your Feature Name`` to be your Feature Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Feature Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_dfa``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Dependent Failure Initiators
----------------------------

.. code-block:: rst

    .. feat_saf_dfa:: <Title>
       :violates: <Feature architecture>
       :id: feat_saf_dfa__<Feature>__<Element descriptor>
       :failure_id: <ID from DFA failure initiators :need:`gd_guidl__dfa_failure_initiators`>
       :failure_effect: "description of failure effect of the failure initiator on the element"
       :mitigated_by: <ID from Feature Requirement | ID from AoU Feature Requirement>
       :mitigation_issue: <ID from Issue Tracker>
       :sufficient: <yes|no>
       :status: <valid|invalid>

 .. note::   argument is inside the 'content'. Therefore content is mandatory

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your feature DFA.

    - The above "code-block" directive must be updated
    - Fill in all the needed information in the <brackets>
