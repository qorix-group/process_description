Dependent Failure Analysis
==========================

.. document:: [Your Feature Name] DFA
   :id: doc__feature_name_dfa
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_D
   :realizes: wp__sw_feature_dfa
   :tags: template

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Feature.

    - Modify ``Your Feature Name`` to be your Feature Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Feature Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_dfa``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Dependent Failure Intitiators
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: rst

   .. feat_saf_dfa:: <Element descriptor>
      :id: feat_saf_DFA__<Feature>__<Element descriptor>
      :violation_id: <ID from Dependent Failure Initiators list :need:`gd_guidl__dfi`>
      :violation_effect: <Effect caused by the initiator (leading to a violation of a safety goal)>
      :verifies: <ID from Feature Architecture>
      :mitigated_by: < NONE|ID from Feature Requirement>
      :sufficient: <yes|no>
      :argument: <text to argument why measure is sufficient>
      :status: <valid|invalid>

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your feature DFA.

    - Remove the ``code-block``
