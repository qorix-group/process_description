   Each architectural element shall have a unique ID. It shall be in a format which is also human readable and consists of

      * type of architectural element
      * structural element (e.g. some part of the feature tree, component acronym)
      * keyword describing the content of the architectural element

   The naming convention is defined here: `REPLACE_doc__naming_conventions`

.. gd_req:: Architecture attribute: security
   :id: gd_req__arch_attr_security

   Each architectural element shall have a automotive safety integrity level (ASIL) identifier:

      * QM
      * ASIL_B
      * ASIL_D

.. gd_req:: Architecture attribute: status
   :id: gd_req__arch__attr_status
   :status: valid
   :tags: attribute, mandatory
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6425
