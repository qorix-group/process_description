      The "doc_tool" type is described in :ref:`tlm_process_requirements`.

.. gd_req:: Document Author
   :id: gd_req__doc__author
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_1_automation
   :satisfies: wf__platform__cr_mt_platform_mgmt_plan
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_1045

   The version management tool shall document and report (be able to show) the authorship of a document.
   I.e. for each change of a document the author of the changes is stored.

.. gd_req:: Document Reviewer
   :id: gd_req__doc__reviewer
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_1_automation
   :satisfies: wf__platform__cr_mt_platform_mgmt_plan
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_1043

   The version management tool shall document and report (be able to show) the reviewers of a document.
   I.e. for each change of a document the reviewers of the change are stored.

.. gd_req:: Document Approver
   :id: gd_req__doc__approver
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_1_automation
   :satisfies: wf__platform__cr_mt_platform_mgmt_plan
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_1045

   The version management tool shall document and report (be able to show) the approver of a document.
   I.e. for each change of a document the approver of the change is stored,
   which is usually the person with "write-rights" on the document approving
   the merge of a Pull Request (this may also be more than one person).
   Note that every approver is also reviewer.
