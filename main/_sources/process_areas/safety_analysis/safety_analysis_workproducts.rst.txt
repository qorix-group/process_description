   | Dependent Failure Analysis on component/module level
   | - Detection and prevention mitigations linked to Software Component Requirements or Assumptions of Use
   | Perform analysis of safety related and non-safety related sub-elements or sub-elements with different ASIL.
   | Perform analysis on interactions between safety related and non-safety related sub-components or sub-components with different ASIL of one component. Including potential influences from the other components in the component's module.
