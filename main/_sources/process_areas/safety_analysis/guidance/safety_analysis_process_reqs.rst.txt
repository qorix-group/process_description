====================================

.. note:: Safety analysis is used as a umbrella term for the methods DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis) and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis).

   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6432

   Safety Analysis (FMEA and DFA) shall be hierarchically grouped into different levels.

   Following levels are defined:

      * Feature architecture
