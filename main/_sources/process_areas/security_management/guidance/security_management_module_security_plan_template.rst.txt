Module Security Plan Template
=============================

.. gd_temp:: Module Security Plan Template
   :id: gd_temp__module_security_plan
   :status: valid
   :complies:

   Will be moved to Folder Templates (tbd https://github.com/eclipse-score/process_description/issues/109)
   For the content see here: need:`doc__module_name_security_plan`
   Will also adapted to the latest Safety Plan Template



   | **1. Security Management Context**
   | This Security Plan adds to the :ref:`process_security_management` all the module development relevant work products needed for ISO SAE 21434 conformity.
   |
   | **2. Security Management Scope**
   | This Security Plan's scope is a SW module of the SW platform <link to module documentation in platform/modules/<modulename>/index.rst>.
   | The module consists of one or more SW components and will be qualified as a EooC.
   |
   | **3. Security Management Roles**

   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Security Manager          | <link to Module's Security Manager assignment or name>       |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Project Manager           | <link to Module's Technical/Module Lead assignment or name>  |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

   | **4. Tailoring**
   | Additional to the tailoring in the SW platform project as defined in the :ref:`process_security_management` we define here the additional tailoring on module level.
   |
   | - Excluded for this module are additionally the following work products (and their related requirements):
   |   - <ISO SAE 21434 reference>: <work product/requirement> - <Argumentation why it is not needed or replaced by another work product or activity.>
   |
   | **5. Security Module Work Products**
   | One set of workproducts for the module and one set for each component of the module:
