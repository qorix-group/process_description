   Requirements shall be hierarchically grouped into three levels.

   Following levels are defined:

      * Stakeholder requirement
      * Feature requirement
      * Component requirement

   Additionally there shall be the following logical groups of requirements:
      * Assumption of use requirement
      * Process requirement
      * Tool requirement

   Each requirement shall have a unique ID. It shall consist of three parts:

      * type of requirement
      * structural element (e.g. some part of the feature tree, component acronym)
      * keyword describing the content of the requirement.

   Consider the project's naming convention.

   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6432
   :satisfies: wf__req_stkh_req, wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   Bi-directional traceability shall be provided by adding a "back-link" via attribute satisfied by (i.e. make a <-> out of the <- in :need:`gd_req__req_linkage`).

.. gd_req:: Requirement attribute: requirement covered
   :id: gd_req__req_attr_req_cov

   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6425, std_req__iso26262__support_6434

   Based on the requirement versioning it shall be checked if a parent requirement was updated but not the linked child requirements (or tests).
   In case an update was detected, the attribute requirement (or test) covered shall be set to "No"

   Note: This refers to :need:`gd_req__req_attr_req_cov` and :need:`gd_req__req_attr_test_covered`

.. gd_req:: Requirements mandatory attributes provided
   :id: gd_req__req_check_mandatory
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_1_automation, check
   :satisfies: wf__req_stkh_req, wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   It shall be checked if all mandatory attributes for each requirement is provided by the user. For all requirements following attributes shall be mandatory:

   .. needtable:: Overview mandatory requirement attributes
      :filter: "mandatory" in tags and "attribute" in tags and "requirements_engineering" in tags and type == "gd_req" and is_external == False
      :style: table
      :columns: title
      :colwidths: 30

.. gd_req:: Requirements no weak words
   :id: gd_req__req_desc_weak
   :status: valid
   :tags: done_automation, check
   :satisfies: wf__req_stkh_req, wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   It shall be ensured that no *weak words* are contained in the requirement description for:

   * Stakeholder Requirements
   * Feature Requirements
   * Component Requirements
   * Tool Requirements

   List of these weak words: just, about, really, some, thing, absolutely (to be extended)


.. gd_req:: Requirements linkage level
   :id: gd_req__req_linkage_fulfill
   :status: valid
   :tags: done_automation, check
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6432
   :satisfies: wf__req_stkh_req, wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   Every feature- and component requirement shall be linked to at least one parent requirement according to the defined traceability scheme:

   :ref:`traceability concept for requirements`

.. gd_req:: Requirements linkage architecture
   :id: gd_req__req_linkage_architecture
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_2_automation, check
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6423
   :satisfies: wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   It shall be checked if every feature- and component requirement is linked at least to one valid architectural element on the same level.

.. gd_req:: Requirements linkage architecture switch
   :id: gd_req__req_linkage_architecture_switch
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_2_automation, check
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6423
   :satisfies: wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req

   The check :need:`gd_req__req_linkage_architecture` shall only be enabled for a release build, otherwise it would block creating requirements first without architecture.

.. gd_req:: Requirements linkage safety
   :id: gd_req__req_linkage_safety
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_1_automation, check
   :satisfies: wf__req_stkh_req, wf__req_feat_req, wf__req_comp_req
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6422

   It shall be checked that (child) QM requirements (Safety == QM) can not be linked against a (parent) safety requirement (Safety != QM).

   Note: This ensures that safety requirements are properly derived into their children. Also a mix of safe and QM aspects in a parent is avoided by this.
