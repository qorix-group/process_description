Configuration Management Process Requirements
=============================================

.. gd_req:: Unique Id
   :id: gd_req__configuration_uid
   :status: valid
   :tags: done_automation, config_mgt
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_745, std_req__aspice_40__SUP-8-BP8
   :satisfies: wf__monitor_verify_requirements, wf__mr_vy_arch, wf__mr_saf_analyses_dfa, wf__vy_saf_analyses_dfa, wf__platform__mr_im_platform_mgmt_plan

   The doc-as-code tool shall check that the Id's of the configuration items (documented in doc-as-code) are unique.

   Note: For definition of configuration items see :need:`doc_concept__configuration__process`

.. gd_req:: Permanent Storage
   :id: gd_req__config__workproducts_storage
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_3_automation, config_mgt
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_745, std_req__aspice_40__SUP-8-BP8
   :satisfies: wf__rel__platform_rel_note, wf__rel__mod_rel_note

   At least every platform release shall be stored permanently as a collection of text documents
   (docs and code) including the used OSS tooling outside of github servers.

   Note: This is to ensure to have the development artefacts available during the complete lifetime of the
   products (cars) the SW platform is used in.

.. gd_req:: Storage of pull requests documentation
   :id: gd_req__config__pull_request_storage
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_2_automation, config_mgt
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_6433, std_req__iso26262__software_7414
   :satisfies: wf__monitor_verify_requirements, wf__mr_vy_arch

   The content of pull requests (conversation, commits, files changed) shall be stored permanently
   for every release.

   Note: The reason is that the PRs could be altered after the release and therefore for example the inspection documented within the review would be corrupted.

.. gd_req:: Baseline Differences
   :id: gd_req__config__baseline_diff
   :status: valid
   :tags: prio_2_automation, config_mgt
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__support_741
   :satisfies: wf__rel__platform_rel_note, wf__rel__mod_rel_note

   It shall be possible to show the differences between two baselines.

   Note: This could be done by showing all the commits which happened between these baselines in one release branch.
