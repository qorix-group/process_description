Workflows Configuration Management
##################################

The main work product is the configuration management plan, which is a part of the platform management plan.
Thus the work flow :need:`wf__platform__cr_mt_platform_mgmt_plan` applies.

Baselines (sets of configuration items and their versions) defining a SW Release on platform or module level
are created as part of this process but are documented in the respective release notes.
This is part of workflows :need:`wf__rel__mod_rel_note` and :need:`wf__rel__platform_rel_note`
