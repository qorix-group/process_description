.. doc_getstrt:: Getting Started on Problem Resolution
   :id: doc_getstrt__problem__process
   :status: valid
   :tags: problem_resolution

This document describes the steps to create a problem report, and further to analyze,
resolve, and to control the problem until closure. Where a problem is defined as a
deviation of an expected result.

Examples for problem origins:

* Deviations relating to requirements, architecture, implementation or code found by user of the platform.
* Deviations found by contributor based on component, feature or platform integration tests.
* Deviations found by Quality Management activities as defined in the Quality Management Plan.

Therefore guidelines :need:`gd_temp__problem__template`,
:need:`gd_guidl__problem__problem` and a :need:`doc_concept__problem__process`
are available.

General Workflow
****************

The workflows are defined in the :ref:`problem_workflows` section.

For every problem identified, the following workflows are executed:

* Create your problem report according to :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`
* Analyze your problem report according to :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`
* Initiate problem resolution and monitor it until closure according to :need:`wf__problem__initiate_monitor_pr`
* Close the problem resolution according to :need:`wf__problem__close_pr`

In addition create a problem resolution plan as part of the platform management plan according to :need:`wf__platform__cr_mt_platform_mgmt_plan`.
