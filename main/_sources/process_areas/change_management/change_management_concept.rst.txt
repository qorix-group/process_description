.. doc_concept:: Concept Description
   :id: doc_concept__change_process
   :status: valid
   :tags: change_management

In this section a concept for the Change Management will be discussed. Inputs for this concepts
are both the requirements of ISO26262 Part-8 and ASPICE Requirements from SUP.10 additionally
including the requirements of the different stakeholders for the Change Management process.

Key concept
***********
A Change Request is the **ONLY** way to contribute new features or to modify the scope
of existing features in the project.
As features are built-up by Components a Change Request is also needed to add new
Components or to modify the scope of existing Components.
As a Software Module is defined as the top-level Component, all statements here for
Components are also valid for Software Modules.

Inputs
******

#. Stakeholders for the Change Requests?
#. Which attributes are required?
#. Which activities are required?

Stakeholders for the Change Requests
************************************

#. :need:`Contributor <rl__contributor>`

   * In general contributes features and components to grow the project content
   * Creates change requests, analyzes changes, implement changes

#. :need:`Committer <rl__committer>`

   * Verifies that the contribution including change requests fulfills the project policies
   * Approves all change request activities besides changes closing
   * Is responsible to initiate the the closure of the change request

#. :need:`Technical Lead <rl__technical_lead>`, :need:`Module Lead <rl__module_lead>`

   * Supports all change request activities
   * Approves the closing of the change request

#. :need:`Safety Manager <rl__safety_manager>`, :need:`Security Manager <rl__security_manager>`, :need:`Quality Manager <rl__quality_manager>`

   * Supports all change request activities

Standard Requirements
=====================

Also requirements of standards need to be taken into consideration:

* ISO 26262
* ASPICE
* ISO SAE 21434

.. _chm_attributes:

Attributes of Change Requests
*****************************

The required attributes for the Change Request are defined here: :ref:`chm_process_change_request_attributes`.


Activities for a Change Request
*******************************

.. _chm_creation:

Creation of the Change Request
==============================
Use the content :ref:`Feature Request Template <chm_feature_templates>` or
:ref:`Component Request Template <chm_component_templates>` to create a Change Request.

In case safety or security is affected, in addition the impact analysis template
: :ref:`Impact Analysis Template <chm_impact_analysis_templates>` can be used to detail
out the impact on safety/security.

.. _chm_analysis:

Analysis of the Change Request
==============================
Based on the analysis results decision about the acceptance or rejection must be taken
by authorized persons.

Authorized person includes

#. :need:`Technical Lead <rl__technical_lead>`
#. :need:`Module Lead <rl__module_lead>`
#. :need:`Safety Manager <rl__safety_manager>`
#. :need:`Security Manager <rl__security_manager>`
#. :need:`Quality Manager <rl__quality_manager>`

Further prioritization must be done, e.g. based on release planning.

.. _chm_implementation_monitoring:

Implementation and Monitoring of the Change Request
===================================================
If the Change Request is accepted, the implementation of the change must be initiated and
monitored.

The Change Request implementation must be tracked until it is closed.

The status of the Change Request must be communicated by the
:need:`Technical Lead <rl__technical_lead>` or :need:`Module Lead <rl__module_lead>` until
the implementation is completed and confirmed.

.. _chm_closing:

Closing of the Change Request
=============================

Use the :ref:`Change Request Review Checklist <chm_checklist>` to control the completeness of the
Change Request to be closed.

Especially the effectiveness of the solution measures must be shown, based on convincing
arguments, e.g. verification measures must be used to confirm the implementation.

The standards require that a Change Request can be traced throughout the complete
hierarchy levels including all affected work products.

In general the traceability is visualized in the general traceability concept (:ref:`general_concepts_traceability`).
