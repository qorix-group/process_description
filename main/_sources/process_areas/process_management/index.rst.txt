Automation Status via Process Requirement Table
***********************************************

All process requirements should be labelled with the priorization of automation implementation:

- A label "manual" means nothing to do, because it must be fulfilled manually (e.g. by filling attributes).
- A label "done_automation" means nothing to do, because it already works. Note that in docs-as-code repository there are tool requirements linking to the process requirements with an "Implemented" attribute.
- A label "prio_*_automation" means the prio 1, 2, ... labelled requirement shall be implemented in this order. Prio 1 is everything we need for the re-audit, prio 2 could be done manually as a fallback, prio 3 is nice to have ...
